Frontend tasks
==============
Firstly, I am going to complete the task for making the component acessible without changing the markup too much.
Accessibility could be achieved with a `select` element, but I believe you are looking for using aria labels so I have
decided to take that approach.

I have realised that I am getting a 500 error trying to access the server for data.
I can bypass this by creating a proxy response.
